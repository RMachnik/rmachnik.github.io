### Do I want to become an Architect?

`NO`

Let me start with `why` I am sharing this.
Recently, I've applied for the Architect role in some middle-size company.
I had very nice and interesting interview. I wanted to know why they look for the Architect, what are the challenges
they have and want to overcome with the help of this role.
Then, I openly said: `I don't want to be an architect`.

`WHAT?`

This confused my interviewers.
They were trying to understand why am I applying for that role, if I don't want to be the Architect.

### Why I don't want to be the Architect?

`I don't want to tell people what and how things needs to be done. I want to do things with them. 
Understand why and figure out what and how together with Teams.`

I strongly believe that things get simple if we understand who is paying our bills - `CUSTOMERS`.
Once all employees in the organisation pays attention to customers most things become clear.

Teams should understand why they do software. Once they do that, perspective will change. 
They will start to care about the software and maintenance, effectively the precious customer. 
Teams will collectively come out with solutions. 
`You ship it, you run it` - power comes with responsibility, if we have capabilities of delivering software we should take 
responsibility of taking right care of it.

In a nutshell this is my view.
