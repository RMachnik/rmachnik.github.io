### Do I want to become an Architect?

`NO`

Let me start with `why` I wanted to share this.
Recently, I've applied for the Architect role in small company.
I had very interesting interview when I openly said: `I don't want to be an architect`.

`WHAT?`

Yes, my interviewers were quite surprised with thing I've said. 
They were asking question why am I applying for that role if I don't want to be the Architect.
Before I said my contradictory statement I asked them precisely what challenges they have that motivates
them to employ an Architect. They told me what they are. What was cool. I really appreciate honesty. 

Let me explain you why I don't want to be the Architect.

`I don't want to tell people what to do, I want to tell them what needs to be done and help them to understand that.`

Stay tuned... more to come.
