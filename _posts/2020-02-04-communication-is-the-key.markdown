### Communication
I would start with thesis that communication is the equally important as technical skills to become
fully professional software engineer.

### Why
Most of us work in Teams. In order to work effectively we need to communicate in the same way.
With bad communication our day to day live will be very sad and our effectiveness will go low.
By any means I am not going to say here that you need to be the nicest person in the room, social butterfly.
What I mean here is that you need to communicate with equally professional attitude as you code. 

Bad code will be equally dangerous to success of your code as the bad communication.

### What is good communication?
* clear - you need to express your thoughts in clear understandable way
if you do it in non native language this might be difficult so here is where you should put effort as well
* professional - remember this is work it is not your home, stay professional, keep your voice calm and emotions under control.
This will help to keep atmosphere nice and clean even if there are different opinions and views.
* honest - if you are wrong, just admit that, people will respect that, don't play games
if someone else is wrong just say that why you think someone else is wrong - what made you think that, stay away from personal trips
if you work remotely - turn on your camera, don't hide yourself

#### What helps?
* ask questions - there are no stupid questions - as long as you keep your language professional, there are only answers that might be stupid
* not too long - try to keep your messages short, average person can hold their focus for short time - approx 10 - 20 min
* [use I](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/i-message) -
if someone say something you hurt your feelings or well being, use I and say `I don't like what you've just said, it makes me feel...`
* listen - understand other person view, only then address your concerns if needed

### Reading time
I really recommend reading great book: [Crucial Conversations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15014.Crucial_Conversations).
In my opinion it is the best book about communication I've ever read.
It helped me to understand mechanics of the conversation
and find ways to deal when things go hot.
