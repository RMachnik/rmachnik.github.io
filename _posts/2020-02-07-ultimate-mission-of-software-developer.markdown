### Mission?
#### Is software development my passion?
Most of people reading this article responded yes. I like software development. 
I could not stand it in other case. How would I sit in front of screen for more than 6h per day?
Hoping that we do what we are really passionate about it would be good to realize what could help us
to keep our work interesting and satisfactory.

From time to time we think that we need to do boring stuff because project we work in is old, boring etc.

Let me do one step back and again ask few questions.
* Who pays software engineer? - clients. 
* What is the outcome of our work?  - digital solution to the real life problem.
* How would you describe good piece of software that you as user like to use? - the one that solves problem.

Answering on above question reveals the mission consider as the most important for Software Developers. 
Once we understand what it our life will be easier. 

### Why?
Because we will focus on right things, as the outcome we will start delivering software that makes sense and 
people will appreciate it. Happy Client = Happy Programmer.
Happy Developer is using modern technologies, have time to learn, have change to test solutions in production.

### My story
Sometimes I felt that people doing software development do not understand that. Even I was a person like that.
At the beginning of my career I struggled. I was frustrated.
>Why I can't use modern stack and I need to use old java 6?
Why business is not willing to give us money/time to deal with tech debt? Why I was not able to learn, experience 
new technologies? 

I've changed job, but it didn't help much. In the next place all was the same after some time.

After I realized all above my life changed. I was trying to understand business need, real problem, when my clients 
saw that, they saw that they can work with me as a partner, not seeing me as cost only. 
Working together will bring value. They were more eager to let me use new technologies. 
They saw that this will give them advantage.

You will immediately notice the same becoming a boos. If you hire software developer or company you will expect them
to bring your business value. Value means solution to your business challenges, this means money to pay that company.
You would not be interested to give developers opportunity to play with modern stack or learn new technologies.

That's all for now.
